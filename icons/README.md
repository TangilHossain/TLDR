# Icon Files

Since we can't generate actual PNG images, you'll need to create icon files for the extension:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels for the toolbar
2. **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels for the extension management page  
3. **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels for the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design Suggestions:

- Use a Facebook blue color scheme (#1877F2)
- Include a magnifying glass or search symbol
- Simple, clean design that works at small sizes
- Consider using a "FB" text with a scraping/data symbol

## Creating Icons:

You can use tools like:
- **Canva** - Free online design tool
- **GIMP** - Free image editor
- **Photoshop** - Professional image editor
- **Figma** - Free design tool
- **IconGenerator** - Online icon generator

## Temporary Solution:

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any existing 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files
3. Rename them to icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png

Place all icon files in the `/icons/` folder.
